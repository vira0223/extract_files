# extract_files  

This is a simple program to extract image files in MacOS X Photo libs.  
Please execute `python app/extract_files.py` in where your current directory is -  
 `PhotoLibrary.photoslibrary` > `Masters` > `yyyy` > `mm` > `dd` > `yyyymmdd-somethingIndex` > `xxx.PNG`  

After copying, the file `.last_month` will be created, which has `last copied month`.
Copying will start since `last copied month` in your next executing.
